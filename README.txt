Title:Ball Simulation;

Description Of Project:  
This is a small script that creates balls with random location, velocity and gravity when clicking on the page. The circles move through an array of color mimicing the movements of a ball as they bounce on the page. At anypoint the balls can be clicked to pop them.

How to Run:
To run the script download the repository and put the HTML file over your address bar. Click the page to start the game.

Possible Future Imporvements:
Divorce the click event when popping a ball from clicking the body, so that balls are only added when the body is clicked directly.
Add mass to the balls.
